# Security Risk Assessment – Botium Toys

## Context

This project simulates a full security review of a retail organization managing internal systems, ecommerce platforms, and customer payment data.

The objective was to evaluate existing controls, identify governance gaps, and assess overall risk exposure.

## Scope and Goals

The assessment covered assets, access controls, data protection, monitoring capabilities, business continuity, and compliance alignment.

Goals:
- Identify control gaps
- Evaluate risk exposure
- Prioritize remediation actions

## Key Findings

- Access governance is the most critical weakness
- Sensitive data is not encrypted
- No IDS or structured monitoring
- No disaster recovery or backup strategy
- Baseline protection exists but lacks layered defense

Overall Risk Score: 8 / 10 (High)

## Takeaway

The primary weakness is not the absence of individual controls, but the lack of structured oversight and enforcement.

This lab demonstrates applied risk analysis, governance evaluation, and practical prioritization aligned with real-world security operations.
