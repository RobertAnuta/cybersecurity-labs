# Control Categories

Controls within cybersecurity are grouped into three main categories:

- Administrative / Managerial controls
- Technical controls
- Physical / Operational controls

Each category plays a different role in reducing risk and protecting organizational assets.

## Administrative / Managerial Controls

Administrative controls address the human and governance component of cybersecurity.

These controls include policies and procedures that define how data is managed and clarify employee responsibilities, including their role in protecting the organization.

While administrative controls are policy-based, effective enforcement often requires support from technical or physical controls.

Examples include:

- Least Privilege
- Separation of Duties
- Password Policies
- Access Control Policies
- Account Management Policies
- Disaster Recovery Plans

These controls focus on reducing insider risk, limiting unnecessary access, and ensuring accountability.

## Technical Controls

Technical controls are technology-based solutions designed to protect systems and data.

They include mechanisms such as:

- Firewalls
- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
- Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)
- Antivirus (AV) software
- Encryption
- Backup systems
- Password management solutions
- Manual monitoring and maintenance processes

Technical controls help prevent, detect, and recover from security incidents.

They are essential for implementing layered defense.

## Physical / Operational Controls

Physical controls are safeguards that protect physical assets and infrastructure from unauthorized access.

Examples include:

- Door locks
- Cabinet locks
- Surveillance cameras (CCTV)
- Badge readers
- Time-controlled safes
- Fire detection and prevention systems

These controls reduce the risk of physical tampering, theft, or environmental damage.

## Control Types

Security controls can also be categorized by function.

### Preventative

Designed to stop incidents before they occur.

Examples:
- Least Privilege
- Firewalls
- Password policies
- Antivirus software

### Detective

Used to identify incidents in progress or after they occur.

Examples:
- IDS
- CCTV monitoring
- Fire detection systems

### Corrective

Help restore systems or operations after an incident.

Examples:
- Backups
- Disaster recovery plans

### Deterrent

Discourage malicious activity by increasing perceived risk of detection or failure.

Examples:
- Security signage
- Visible surveillance systems
- Time-controlled safes

## How These Controls Work Together

No single control provides complete protection.

Strong security posture requires balance across:

- Governance (Administrative)
- Technology (Technical)
- Physical safeguards (Operational)
- Preventative, detective, and corrective layers

When implemented together, these controls create defense in depth and reduce overall organizational risk.
