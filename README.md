# Cybersecurity Labs

Building practical cybersecurity experience through structured detection and network labs.
This repository focuses on developing defensive security capability through hands-on lab environments using VirtualBox, pfSense, and Linux systems.
My background in compliance governance and data-driven risk analysis shapes how I approach security problems: identify gaps, understand root cause, and improve controls.

## Core Focus

- Network segmentation and firewall configuration  
- Traffic flow analysis  
- Detection development  
- Incident investigation simulations  
- Structured application of the NIST framework
